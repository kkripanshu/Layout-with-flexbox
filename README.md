Flexbox Layout Changer with Typing Heading
This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic Flexbox layout in React. Users can select different Flexbox layouts such as row, column, row-reverse, and column-reverse from a dropdown, and the layout of the container changes accordingly.

Additionally, a fun typing effect for the heading is included, where the text types out with changing colors and fonts, creating a visually engaging experience.

Key Features:
Dynamic Flexbox Layout: Allows users to change the layout of the container using a dropdown menu.

Typing Effect: A heading text that types out letter by letter with changing colors and fonts.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts according to the chosen direction (row, column, etc.) while keeping the height fixed to prevent shifting during text animation.

Tailwind CSS: Fully styled with Tailwind CSS for a quick and efficient styling approach.

React State Management: Uses React useState to manage the layout and text display.

Technologies Used:
React: For building the interactive user interface.
Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling.
React Hooks: Utilized useState and useEffect to manage the state and implement the typing animation.
